Hey, whatcha got in here? I lost something so let me see if you have it.
Uh, no I don't put my name on stuff unless someone makes me. You gonna make me?
I can't remember what color it was.
Why do you care about my uniform? It's mine afterall I'll wear it how I like it.
Uh yeah, sure it's the [color] one. (Uses whatever color you suggested)
Fine. I'll go. Are you sure I can't just snag something real quick though? (Sent them away for uniform check/contraband)
Yeah this is mine. Thanks a lot! (Given any item)
