Hey! Did you steal my book? You better give it back right now.
Duh, of course it has my name on it. Idiot.
Ugh, it's red. Stop wasting my time and give it to me.
My uniform? I don't care about my uniform. Give me back my book!
Just let me look. I'm sure I can find it faster than you.
It's red. You should know that by now.
What do you mean it's not here? (No item that matches)
Ugh, I'll just take this one. (Failure, lose an item for taking too long)
You can't send me away! I'll be back! (Sent them away for uniform check/contraband)
This isn't mine idiot! (Wrong Item)
Thanks. (Success)
