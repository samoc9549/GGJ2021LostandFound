You there, do you have my Teddy Bear?
Not yet, I'm planning on having his paw monogrammed though.
Ugh, he's golden brown you dolt. Have you no taste?
My uniform? I'll have you know that I'm the one who sets the dress code here!
Do you know who my Father is? Just give me the best Teddy you have. Obviously mine is the finest.
My [object] is [color], it's the only one that looks any good after all.
His name? Beary of course, a fine name for a fine bear.
You don't have it? Fine, I'll just get Father to buy me a new one. (No item that matches)
My Father will hear about this! (Sent them away for uniform check/contraband)
This is definitely not mine. Gross. (Wrong Item)
Thanks! I'm gonna see if I can get Daddy to give you a raise! (Success)
