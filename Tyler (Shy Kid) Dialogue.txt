Um, excuse me, do you maybe have a... um... water bottle?
Oh no. I didn't put my name on it. I'm sorry.
Um... I think it's blue.
Oh no. Is something wrong with my uniform? I'm sorry.
No, I'm sorry. Um, my water bottle is blue.
Um, yeah. It's blue.
Oh dear. I'm sorry. Maybe I left it at home. (No item that matches)
I'm sorry, it won't happen again. (Sent them away for uniform check/contraband)
Um, no. I don't think I should take something that isn't mine. (Wrong Item)
Thank you! I'll try not to lose it again. (Success)
