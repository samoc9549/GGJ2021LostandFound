Hi there, do you happen to have a water bottle? I can't find mine anywhere.
I don't remember putting my name on it.
I think it was blue. Water's blue right? So it's blue!
My uniform? Oh whoops, I'll fix that right away!
I'm pretty sure it was blue... unless... no blue feels right.
Wait no you're right my water bottle is purple!
You don't have it? Weird, it must still be in my backpack then. (No item that matches)
Aw. I guess I forgot about that rule. (Sent them away for uniform check/contraband)
Um, I think this is mine. Probably. Thanks! (Wrong Item, lose the item you gave her)
Oh yeah! This is definitely my water bottle. Thanks a lot! (Success)
